    Thanks for taking this up, tags are very useful.  I have two
    suggestions: why not write the file sorted by default?  Also, if you
    put '!_TAG_FILE_SORTED\t1\t ~' on the first line, vim will assume it's
    sorted and not fall back on the slow linear search when it doesn't
    find a tag.
