hasktags: a tool to generate tag files for vim and emacs

  What is it for? A tag file is a index containing key items of your project such as
  - function names
  - module names
  - data declarations
  - ...

  so that you can find / jump to them fast.

HOWTO:
  ghc --make hasktags.hs

  I've been using this bash function or something similar for a long time.
  It may be cumbersome but works:

  runHaskTagsVim() {
          hasktags-modified -c --ignore-close-implementation `find -L . -iname "*.hsc"|grep -v _darcs` `find -L . -iname "*.hs"|grep -v _darcs` `find -L . -iname "*.lhs"|grep -v _darcs`
  }

test cases:
  cd testcases; sh test.sh



history:
In the past this tool was distributed with ghc. I forked and added some
features.  hasktags itself was moved out of the ghc repository. Then I only
verified that my fork finds at least as much tags as the one forked by Igloo.
